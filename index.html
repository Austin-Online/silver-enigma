    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Austin Shook and I am a prospective full stack developer.  I was born and raised in Catawba County and currently reside in Claremont, NC where I raise my three kids alongside my wife. I've always had my interests firmly in the technology industry, whether it's consumer tech or server tech.  After a brief 6-month contract with Apple, I decided to make the career leap and specialize in IT and Networking. Now, I am transitioning into a more development focused endeavor, and the material below me showcases the projects that I have contribution in.</p>
